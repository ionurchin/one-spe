## Example Protocol for Trypsin Digestion Followed by One-SPE Sample Cleanup

#### Solutions:
* 10x SDC: 10% SDC in 100mM HEPES pH 8.5
* Digest Buffer: 100mM HEPES pH 8.5, 1% sodium deoxycholate (SDC)
* Reduction Bufer (10x): 100mM dithiothreitol, 100mM HEPES pH 8.5, 1% SDC
* Alkylation Buffer (10x): 200mM 2-chloroacetamide (CAA), 100mM HEPES pH 8.5, 1% SDC
* Trypsin Solution (10x): 125ng/ul Methylated Trypsin, 100mM HEPES, pH 8.5, 1% SDC
* SPE Load Buffer: 90% Acetonitrile (Isopropanol if using TCEP), 1.0% Formic Acid
* SPE Wash Buffer: 10% Acetonitrile, 0.1% Formic Acid
* SPE Elution Buffer: 80% Acetonitrile, 5% Ammonium Hydroxide (IMPORTANT!  Must be made up fresh)

#### Sample considerations:
* Components of the sample must not inhibit the enzymatic activity Trypsin.
* The sample may contain detergents or polymers that are uncharged or negatively charged.
* SDC is used to denature the proteins and enhance the activity of Trypsin.
* SDC precipitates in acidic conditions.  If using TCEP the pH of this solution must be neutralized before adding it to the reaction.
* Calcium causes SDC to precipitate.

#### Reduce and alkylate:
*The final reaction volume (after adding Trypsin) is 50ul. Adjust the volumes of other components as necessary for other reaction volumes.*
1. Add 20ul of Digest Buffer.
2. Add 10ul of sample.
3. Add 1ul of 10x SDC (add if the sample doesn't have SDC already).
4. Add 5ul of Reduction Buffer. Vortex to mix.
5. Incubate at 70C for 10min then cool to RT.
6. Add 5ul of Alkylation Buffer. Vortex to mix.
7. Incubate at 70C for 10min then cool to RT.
8. Add 5ul of Reduction Buffer. Vortex to mix.
9. Incubate at RT for a few minutes to allow the DTT to react with residual CAA.

#### Trypsin digestion:
1. Add 5ul of Trypsin Solution to the above reduced and alkylated samples.
2. Incubate at RT O/N (14 - 18hrs) with gentle vortex mixing (alternatively, 4hrs at 37Â°C works well also).
3. Freeze at -70C if not processing immediatly.

#### Solid phase extraction - peptide cleanup:
1. Add 500ul SPE Load Buffer to the digested sample. (10x the volume of the digest volume)
2. Mix by pipetting up and down and transfer to a p1000 pipet tip packed with 1 or more 2mm diameter discs of CDS Empore SCX or use Waters MCX products.
3. Spin the liquid through the tip at an adequate g-force until dry.  This takes a few minutes.
4. Wash with 500ul of SPE Load Buffer.  Spin until dry.
5. Wash with 500ul of SPE Wash Buffer.  Spin until dry.
6. Elute bound peptides with 150ul of SPE Elution Buffer directly into injection vials or other tubes.
7. Evaporate to dryness in a centrifugal vacuum concentrator such as a speed-vac.
8. Dissolve peptides in injection solvent appropriate for your LC/MS system.
